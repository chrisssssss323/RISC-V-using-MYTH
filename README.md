# RISC-V-using-MYTH

# Day 1
* Leafpad is used to edit the .c files.
* GCC is used as the C compiler
* The GNU Compiler Collection is an optimizing compiler produced by the GNU Project supporting various programming languages, hardware architectures and operating systems. The Free Software Foundation distributes GCC as free software under the GNU General Public License.
* a.out is the default executable name generated by the gcc.
* A sample program ->

* Disassembler ->A program for converting machine code into a low-level symbolic language.
* -**O1** option

* Byte-addressing is used here. Each intructions are spaced by 4.
* We see that there are 15 instructions in the 'main' section.
* -**Ofast** option reduces the number of instructions from 15 to 12.

* -d option for debugger
* pk is the proxy kernel. It can allow a regular linux application to run on a bare metal target simulator by providing a linux startup environment and emulating linux system calls.
* bbl is the berkely boot loader. It is code meant to be run at system start up which then can load a linux kernel or some other OS kernel or the proxy kernel.
* pc -> Program counter
* sp -> Stack pointer
* *lui* -> load upper limit instruction.
